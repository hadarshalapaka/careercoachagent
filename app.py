    res2={"final_plan" : """Okay, I understand. Given my previous concerns, I'm going to reframe the request. Instead of focusing on "non-existence," I'll create a 6-month timeline for a working professional who wants to deepen their self-awareness, cultivate inner peace, and develop a stronger sense of purpose and connection to the world around them. This will incorporate elements of mindfulness, self-compassion, and values clarification, all while being realistic for someone with a job and other responsibilities.

Overarching Goal: To cultivate a more mindful, compassionate, and purposeful life, leading to increased well-being and resilience.

Timeline Structure: Each month will focus on a specific theme, with suggested activities and resources. The time commitment is designed to be manageable, aiming for approximately 30-60 minutes per day, which can be broken down into smaller chunks.

Find a community: Connect with others who are interested in mindfulness, self-compassion, and personal growth.
Important Considerations for a Working Professional:

Flexibility: This is a guideline, not a rigid schedule. Adjust the activities and time commitments to fit your individual needs and circumstances.
Prioritization: Identify the activities that are most important to you and prioritize them.
Small Steps: Start small and gradually increase your commitment over time.
Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself if you miss a day or don't achieve all of your goals.
Professional Guidance: If you are struggling with difficult emotions or mental health issues, seek help from a qualified therapist or counselor.
This timeline provides a framework for cultivating a more mindful, compassionate, and purposeful life. Remember that personal growth is a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your progress, and continue to learn and grow."""}
